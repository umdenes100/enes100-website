    <h1>Building the next generation of <span>Engineers.</span></h1>
    <h2>In ENES100 we believe that engineering design is the <span>foundation</span> of all engineering. Medical devices, suspension bridges, and everything in between all use the engineering design process. When our students enroll in ENES100 they start to lay <span>their own foundation</span>, one that will last a lifetime. By fostering creative design and solution-oriented thinking we encourage students to face challenges head on and with the confidence of <span>future engineers</span>. </h2>

            <p>This course provides the new engineering student with a roadmap to becoming a professional engineer. This is achieved through the planning, investigation, design, manufacturing, assembly, and evaluation of a product, conducted within the context of a team. In this course, you will be assigned to a team, which provides a framework for equitable logistical coordination and effective communication--by written, oral, and visual modalities. </p>

            <p>You will define problems and apply modeling to develop and analyze an engineering design that applies basic math & science principles to predict behaviors of the system. You will use modeling to inform the improvement of a design through iteration. You will create a prototype of your design and develop testing protocols to gather and analyze data for the performance of the system using variables from the engineering model. </p>

    <h3>Adaptive design is critical - an engineer must be able to roll with changes.</h3>

            <p>Given any discrepancies between the model and reality, you will troubleshoot and assess the performance of the prototype, interpreting the behavior and relating the observations back to design decisions. Finally, you will gain project management skills such as separating a complex project into manageable parts, governing a diverse project team with equity, and using effective tools to ensure the project meets its deliverables and progresses within budget and on schedule.</p>
