            spaces for use and supporting instructors (Monday - Thursday during

            LTFs are not expected to be able to participate in every section of
            the course, but their time needs to be scheduled weekly so that they
            can assist with the same sections each week in terms of overseeing
            the labs, providing demonstrations, and assisting with the
            instruction of content such as Arduino programming.
