# Enes100 Website

There are two types of pages on the website.

## Editing Simple Text Pages

All you need to do is identify the correct markdown file inside the markdown directory. Edit this online using github, 
commit your changes, and in a minute it will be done!

## Editing Interactive Pages
You will need to know HTML, JS, and CSS to edit these pages. You can find the source code in the src/routes directory.

Include installation instructions. Make sure to specify node versions.

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

```
